# Password-Validator
A password validating program to check password
I had used the package bcrypt here for hashing password
You can install it using command line pip install bcrypt
Run the main.py to get your hashed password and save it in the hashed_password in validate.py and after that run the program and you can 
get your result!!!

Thank you!
Happy Coding!
